# Risk_Return_Analysis
For the purpose of this exercise, I assumed the role of a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality. To keep the costs low, the firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.

I've been tasked with evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Legendary fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. (People sometimes refer to these managers as whales because of the large amount of money that they manage). I determined the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## Installation Guide

To use the app, download the risk_return_analysis.ipynb Jupyter file and the Resources Folder. Use either Terminal or Git Bash to run the app in a conda dev environment. 
To enter a conda dev environment, type
'conda activate dev'

To run the app, navigate to the directory containing the risk_return_analysis.inpyb file and then type
'jupyter lab'

## Usage

As you run through the calculations in the kernal, observe how to read a csv file and perform a risk-return rolling statistical analysis. This exercise demonstrates a method of comparing performance of large hedge funds relative to the S&P 500.
